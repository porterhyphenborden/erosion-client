### Description

This logic-based puzzle game offers quick gameplay but allows for complex strategy. The user must shift a grid of tiles to determine the course of the river, which can be manipulated by strategically placing tiles of higher resistance. The final score is influenced by several different factors, making diverse strategies available to the player. Registered users can play multiple maps and view their previous scores.
